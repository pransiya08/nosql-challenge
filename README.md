# nosql-challenge

This challenge requires the user to design a database of various food establishments across the United Kingdom that will be updated and analyse afterwards. Using MongoDB, the json file source is converted into a dataframe to analyse based on different ratings data to provide guidance to the food critics as to where they should focus their evaluation and articles. Analyses based on hygiene and location are the main focus of this script.
